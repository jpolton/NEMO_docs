First Paragraph: 200 words

Coastal and shelf seas around the world are of substantial importance through
 the resources and services they provide. NEW SENTENCE such as fisheries ($bn example) and
 carbon sequestration (PgC example), and through their relation to the high
 populations often found in adjoining countries (M people). They are highly
 constrained by external forcing, mediated by their circulation which determines
 their material properties. Here we present an example of a radical change in a
 shelf sea circulation under two future climate forcing scenarios. We find a new
vulnerability of the shelf sea environment to climate change:

Future changes in open ocean density and circulation patterns enhance the dynamical isolation of (the?) shelf seas.

In this example, the
 North Sea inflow reduces from ~0.8Sv (=106 m3s-1) to 0.4Sv, with the Atlantic
 water largely bi-passing the North Sea.

 These changes are linked to the open ocean circulation through simple geostrophic
 dynamics. If these changes were to be realised there would be far reaching
 implications, making the sea more riverine and susceptible to anthropogenic
 influence, but less vulnerable to climate change effects in the open ocean.
